<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I implemented a cloth simulation. I started out by building a cloth structure using a mesh of point masses and springs. These were arranged using a variety of links including structural, shearing, and bending springs to ensure the cloth maintains it's structure. Next, I allowed the points to move over time using Verlet integration, constraining the spring lengths to ensure stability of the system. Next, I implemented collisions, from the cloth elements to other scene objects in addition to self collisions. Finally, I implemented a variety of shaders for the cloth renders!</p>

<h3>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</h3>
<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/5000.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High (50000)</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/500.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Low (500)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>The spring constant ks affects how "strong" the spring is. When ks is higher, the springs are much more likely to stay very close to their resting positions. When ks is lower, it allows a lot more leeway, stretching further than the high ks version. You can see this clearly in the above images. In the high ks version, the top edge of the cloth does not sag nearly as far as the low ks version.</p>
<h3>What about for density?</h3>
<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/150.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High (150)</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/1.5.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Low (1.5)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>As we know, increasing the density increases the point mass' masses. Because of this, it increases the impact of the force of gravity on each point mass. Thus, when density is high, we can see that the cloth sags a lot, including at the bottom edge. However, when the density is low, most of the behavior of the cloth is due to the spring forces, so we see a much flatter cloth plane.</p>
<h3>What about for damping?</h3>
<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High (1%)</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/0.02.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Low (.02%)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>When the damping is high, the cloth falls very slowly and smoothly with very little oscillation. When the damping is very low, the cloth falls quickly and swings back and forth for a long time (shown in the image above).</p>

<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! If you choose to use different parameters than the default ones, please list them.</h3>

<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</h3>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/s5000.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Default (5000)</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/s500.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Low (500)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/s50000.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High (50000)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>As the spring constant increases, this increases the "strength" of the springs in the cloth. Thus, the high ks image shows fewer folds and much less droop over the sphere (it more closely resembles the original structure of the cloth). As the spring constant decreases, this decreases the strength of the springs in the cloth. Thus, you can see that in the low ks image, there are many folds and lots of droop over the sphere.</p>

<h3>
Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. If you haven't by now, feel free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! (You will need to complete the shaders portion first to show custom colors.)

<h3>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</h3>

<h3>Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</h3>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/highlow.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High density (30), low ks (2500)</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/highhigh.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>High density (30), high ks (10000)</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/lowlow.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Low density (7.5), low ks (2500)</figcaption>

			<figcaption>Low density (7.5), high ks (10000)</figcaption>
		  </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>With high density but low ks, there are many fine folds and creases in the cloth as it self collides. With high ks but low density, the folds are very wide and smooth. When density and ks were both high or both low, there wasn't much noticeable difference.</p>

<h3>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
</h3>

<p>Shader programs are graphics programs designed to represent components of highly paralellizable programs run on GPUs. In the standard pipeline used in this class, we consider vertex and fragment shaders. 
	</p><p>
	Vertex shaders run on each vertex in the scene. These shaders take in geometric information such as vertex positions, normals, uv coordinates, and have access to uniforms like texture information.The vertex shader can perform computations on these details before transfering them over to the fragment shader. For example, the displacement vertex shader displaces verticies along their normal vectors according to texture information. 
</p><p>
	Fragment shaders transform samples of this updated geometry into color samples (fragments). In particular, for each fragment point, they take in values outputted by the vertex shader (interpolated using barycentric coordinates) and output a color. For example, in the diffuse fragment shader, I calculate the outputted color using the light intensity and angle difference with the normal vector. </p>

<h3>
Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
</h3>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/ambient.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Ambient only</figcaption>
		</td>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/diffuse.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
		  <figcaption>Diffuse only</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr align="center">

			<figcaption>Full phong</figcaption>
		  </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model has a couple key components. First, it has an ambient component, which applies a flat color uniformly across the surface. Next, is a diffuse component, which is simply a normal diffuse shader (reflects light spread out evenly across the hemisphere around the normal vector). Finally, there is a specular component, which reflects light spread a bit along the reflection axis. The final color output is a weighted sum of these three components.</p>

<h3>
Show a screenshot of your texture mapping shader using your own custom texture by modifying the textures in /textures/.
</h3>

<h3>
Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. 
</h3>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>
		  <img src="images/bumpcloth.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

</div>

<p>With bump mapping, the geometry of the objects are not changed by the shader. However, the lighting reflection is calculated with a virtual normal vector corresponding to information from the bump map, thus the surface appears rough and textured. With displacement mapping, the geometry of the sphere itself is altered to align with the bump map in addition to the normal modification. You can see this by looking at the edges of the sphere in both images. In the displacement map case, the sphere geometric is pushed in or out according to the texture.</p>

<h3>Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.
</h3>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr align="center">
		<td>

	  </tr>

</div>

<p>Because the bump mapping does not affect the geometry, the bump mapping affects the mesh in exactly the same way with both sphere resolutions. However, the displacement shader physically alters geometry. Thus, a higher resolution sphere will more accurately match the underlying displacement map. Thus, you can see that the low resolution sphere is very sharply bumpy, not fitting the underlying texture very well. Alternatively, the high resolution sphere very smoothly displaces along the texture.</p>

<h3>Explain what you did in your custom shader, if you made one.</h3>
<img src="images/custom.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
<p>For my custom shader, I combined all 5 shaders into one. For the vertex shader, I used my displacement vertex shader to displace the verticies according to the underlying bump/displacement texture. In the fragment shader, I used my bump fragment shader to provide sub-geometry texture. Additionally, I multiplied the ambient and diffuse components of the phong shading with the result of a texture sample. Finally, I added another linear term to the sum which was pure mirror reflection (in addition to the phong specular). This combines into the image above!</p>
